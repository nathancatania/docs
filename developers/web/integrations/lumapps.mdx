description: "Instructions for replacing LumApps' native search functionality with Glean's modal search interface"
---

To integrate Glean's modal search interface into your LumApps environment, you'll need to add custom code to your site's header. This can be done using LumApps' [custom code feature](https://docs.lumapps.com/docs/explore-l02754686794778971?contentV1Fallback=true#l02584482917705644).

<Note>
Replace `{YOUR_GLEAN_DOMAIN}` in the code below with your company's Glean domain (e.g., app.glean.com, company.glean.com)
</Note>

<CodeGroup>
```html HTML Integration Code
<style>
  .searchbox__suggestions {
    display: none !important;
  }
</style>

<script defer src="https://{YOUR_GLEAN_DOMAIN}/embedded-search-latest.min.js"></script>

<script>
  window.addEventListener('load', async () => {
    const getSearchBox = () => document.querySelector(".header-top__search")
    while(!getSearchBox()) { await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 300)) }
    window.GleanWebSDK.attach(getSearchBox())
  })
</script>
```
</CodeGroup>

The integration code performs three key functions:
1. Disables LumApps' native search suggestions using CSS
2. Loads the Glean Web SDK from your company's domain
3. Attaches Glean's search functionality to the LumApps search box once the page has fully loaded

<Info>
The script includes a polling mechanism to ensure the search box element is present before attempting to attach the Glean functionality, preventing any race conditions during page load.
