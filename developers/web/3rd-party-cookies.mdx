Major browsers like Safari, Firefox, and Chrome (including Chromium-based browsers like Edge) have added or are planning to add restrictions to third-party cookie usage. This change entails replacing third-party cookie usage patterns by web browsers with a new partitioned cookie type or blocking them entirely.

## Browser Cookie Policies

<Info>
Google Chrome has announced plans to move towards a more privacy-focused web environment with initiatives like the Privacy Sandbox, which aims to provide personalization while protecting user privacy. Google is planning to introduce a new experience in Chrome that lets people make an informed choice that applies across their web browsing, including (but not limited to) third-party cookie usage.
</Info>

Mozilla Firefox and Apple's Safari have already implemented strict third-party cookie blocking by default:

- Safari uses Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP) to block cookies used by advertisers to track users across sites
- Firefox uses Enhanced Tracking Protection (ETP) for similar functionality
- Other Chromium-based browsers, like Microsoft Edge, are expected to follow Chrome's implementation

## Impact on Glean Functionality

<Warning>
Since Glean is embedded on customers' websites, it is classified as a third-party and this change can have an impact on critical workflows. Glean's embedded widgets and other functionalities rely on third-party cookies for authenticating users and these would be affected if third-party cookies are blocked.
</Warning>

## Granting Cookie Access

Glean has an inbuilt flow that requests users for third-party cookie access if needed. After login, you will see the following screen:

<Frame>
  <img src="../../images/browser-api/third_party_cookies/3P-cookie-request.png" alt="Glean 3P Cookie Access Request" />
</Frame>

To grant access:

1. Click on "Allow Cookies"
2. You will see a browser prompt:

<Frame caption="Browser prompt for third-party cookie access">
  <img src="../../images/browser-api/third_party_cookies/3P-cookie-browser-prompt.png" alt="Browser 3P Cookie Access Prompt" />
</Frame>

3. Click on "Allow" to grant Glean access to third-party cookies
4. Glean will complete the login process successfully

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I grant access if I accidentally clicked 'Block'?">
    If you clicked "Block" when the browser asked for third-party cookie access, any subsequent click on "Allow cookies" will automatically be rejected. To manually grant access:

    1. Click on the cookie access icon <img src="../../images/browser-api/third_party_cookies/cookie-access-icon.png" style={{width: "32px", display: "inline"}} /> in the top-right corner of the URL address bar
    2. In the prompt, switch the glean.com toggle to "On":

    <Frame>
      <img src="../../images/browser-api/third_party_cookies/3P-cookie-chrome-allow.png" alt="Allow Cookies Chrome" />
    </Frame>

    3. Click on "Allow Cookies" in the Glean UI
    4. The login should complete successfully
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why don't I see a prompt after clicking 'Allow Cookies'?">
    This can occur in two scenarios:

    1. Access was previously denied or the prompt was dismissed multiple times (see solution above)
    2. The embedding `iframe` configuration needs to meet specific requirements:
        - If the `iframe` is not sandboxed, there are no issues
        - If sandboxed, it must include these sandbox attributes:
          - `allow-storage-access-by-user-activation`
          - `allow-scripts`
          - `allow-same-origin`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need to grant access for each domain separately?">
    Yes, cookie access is domain-specific. The duration of access varies by browser:

    - **Google Chrome/Chromium:** Access persists for the current user profile
    - **Firefox:** Access persists for the current user profile
    - **Safari:** Access is limited to the current browser tab only
