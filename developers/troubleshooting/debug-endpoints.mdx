This guide provides information about debug endpoints that can help you investigate issues with Glean's REST APIs. For detailed documentation on available debugging endpoints, please refer to our [troubleshooting documentation](https://developers.glean.com/docs/indexing_api/indexing_api_troubleshooting/).

## Debug Endpoints

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="Debug Data Source Status" icon="server">
    **Purpose:**  
    Use this endpoint to verify the success of indexing jobs and confirm document processing status. The endpoint provides timestamps for bulk uploads and processing completion.

    **Request Format**
    ```bash
    curl -i -X POST \
      'https://domain-be.glean.com/api/index/v1/debug/{datasource}/status' \
      -H 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN_HERE>'
    ```

    **Usage Guidelines**
    Monitor the following fields in the response:
    - **bulkUploadHistory**: Shows when documents were last uploaded
    - **processingHistory**: Indicates when documents were last processed

    Documents become available in search results only after the processingHistory timestamp is more recent than the bulkUploadHistory timestamp.

  <Accordion title="Debug Data Source Document" icon="file-lines">
    **Purpose:**  
    Verify a document's presence in the data source index and check its permission settings.

    **Request Format**
    ```bash
    curl -i -X POST \
      'https://domain-be.glean.com/api/index/v1/debug/{datasource}/document' \
      -H 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN_HERE>' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8' \
      -d '{
        "objectType": "Article",
        "docId": "art123"
      }'
    ```

    **Access Conditions**
    A user can view a document if any of these conditions are met:
    - **allowAnonymousAccess** is set to true
    - **allowAllDatasourceUsersAccess** is true and the user is indexed as a data source user
    - The user belongs to the **allowedGroups** and is listed in **allowedUsers** or **allowedGroupIntersections**

  <Accordion title="Debug Data Source User" icon="user-gear">
    **Purpose:**  
    Verify a user's group memberships and access permissions within a data source.

    **Request Format**
    ```bash
    curl -i -X POST \
      'https://domain-be.glean.com/api/index/v1/debug/{datasource}/user' \
      -H 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN_HERE>' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8' \
      -d '{
        "email": "u1@foo.com"
      }'
    ```

    Use this endpoint in conjunction with the Debug Data Source Document endpoint to confirm whether a user has the necessary group memberships for document access.

  <Accordion title="Check Document Access" icon="key">
    **Purpose:**  
    Directly verify whether a specific user has access to view a particular document.

    **Request Format**
    ```bash
    curl -i -X POST \
      https://domain-be.glean.com/api/index/v1/checkdocumentaccess \
      -H 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN_HERE>' \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -d '{
        "datasource": "string",
        "objectType": "string",
        "docId": "string",
        "userEmail": "string"
      }'
    ```

    The endpoint returns a boolean response (**true** or **false**). If access is denied, use the debug data source user and document endpoints to investigate the underlying permission configuration.
