# Getting Started

## Indexing API

The Glean Indexing API allows customers to put arbitrary content in the search index, making it available for Generative AI applications. This is particularly useful for performing permissions-aware searches over content in internal tools that reside on-premises, as well as for searching over applications that Glean does not currently support first class. Additionally, these APIs allow the customer to push organization data (people info, organization structure, etc.) into Glean.

In addition to documents, the Indexing API also supports indexing custom entities. These are structured key-value content, as opposed to being text heavy like documents. This feature is useful when the information is in the form of structured schema that can be represented as key-value type attributes.

Glean provides advance notice of any planned backwards incompatible changes along with a sunset period for anything that requires developers to adopt the new versions. 

A [Python SDK](https://developers.glean.com/docs/indexing_api/indexing_api_getting_started/#using-the-sdk) is available to make it easier to use the Indexing API. SDK bindings can be generated for other popular languages (Java, NodeJS, etc.), too!

For more detailed information, please refer to the [Getting Started Guide](https://developers.glean.com/docs/indexing_api/indexing_api_getting_started/) and the [API Reference](https://developers.glean.com/indexing/overview/).

## Client API

The Glean Client API enables building custom applications atop Glean's search and generative AI capabilities. The platform encompasses all of the capabilities of the first-party Glean client applications as well as additional capabilities for working with connected content.

Glean provides advance notice of any planned backwards incompatible changes along with a sunset period for anything that requires developers to adopt the new versions. 

SDK bindings for the API can be generated for most popular languages (Python, Java, NodeJS, etc). Please refer to the [SDK section](https://developers.glean.com/client/overview/#section/SDK) to generate bindings for your preferred language.

For more detailed information, please refer to the tutorials about [Authentication](https://developers.glean.com/docs/client_api/client_api_scopes/), [Making your first request](https://developers.glean.com/docs/client_api/client_api_first_request/) and the [API Reference](https://developers.glean.com/client/overview/).

## Web SDK

You can also integrate AI powered Search and Chat experiences using the [Web SDK](https://developers.glean.com/docs/browser_api/) into your intranet site.
