## Overview

This guide explains how to create a redirect action that allows users to create Zendesk tickets through Glean Assistant. The implementation uses Glean's Redirect URL Builder to construct properly formatted URLs that pre-populate ticket fields in Zendesk's interface. This approach provides a streamlined experience for users while maintaining the familiar Zendesk environment for ticket creation.

## Understanding Redirect Actions

Before diving into the implementation, it's important to understand that redirect actions differ from execution actions. Instead of directly creating tickets via API calls, redirect actions construct URLs that guide users to Zendesk's ticket creation interface with relevant information already filled in. This approach offers several advantages:

- Users can review and modify ticket details before submission
- No need for complex API authentication handling
- Maintains familiar Zendesk interface for end users
- Reduces implementation complexity and maintenance overhead

## Implementation Process

### Initial Setup

Begin at the Actions settings page in your Glean administration console. When creating a new action, you'll find the Redirect URL Builder option among the available choices.

The Redirect URL Builder provides a user-friendly interface for configuring URL parameters and their behaviors. This tool significantly simplifies the process of creating redirect actions compared to manual URL construction.

### Basic Configuration

The initial configuration requires several key pieces of information that establish the foundation of your redirect action.

First, provide the basic action details:
- Display Name: Choose a clear, descriptive name that helps users understand the action's purpose
- Description: Explain when and how the action should be used
- Unique Identifier: Create a distinctive identifier for system reference
- Trigger Conditions: Define the scenarios that should activate this action

When selecting the action type, the system automatically sets this to "Redirect" based on your use of the URL Builder.

### URL Structure Setup

The foundation of the redirect action is the Zendesk ticket creation URL. The standard format follows this structure:

```text
https://your-org.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new
```

When you include query parameters for field population, the URL expands to include these values:

```text
https://your-org.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?tf_description=new+customer+request&tf_subject=new+customer
```

### Parameter Configuration

The effectiveness of your redirect action depends heavily on proper parameter configuration. Each parameter requires careful consideration to ensure Glean Assistant can populate it appropriately.

To configure parameters for dynamic population:

1. Clear any static values from the "Allowed Values" field
2. Provide detailed guidance in the "Description for LLM" field to help Glean Assistant generate appropriate content
3. Configure the requirement settings based on your ticketing workflow

</Frame>

Essential parameters for Zendesk ticket creation typically include:

1. Description Field Configuration
   - Parameter Name: tf_description
   - Purpose: Contains the detailed explanation of the issue or request
   - Configuration: Enable dynamic population with clear LLM instructions
   - Requirement: Usually marked as required for meaningful ticket creation

2. Subject Field Configuration
   - Parameter Name: tf_subject
   - Purpose: Provides a concise summary of the ticket content
   - Configuration: Allow dynamic generation based on ticket context
   - Requirement: Typically required for proper ticket organization

### Extending Parameter Functionality

The system provides two methods for adding additional parameters to enhance ticket creation functionality.

The first method utilizes the Add Parameter link:

The second method involves direct URL modification:

### Parameter Value Controls

For parameters that require specific values, the system provides robust control mechanisms:

  ![Configuring Allowed Values](./images/RedirectURLBuilder_6.png)
</Frame>

When implementing value controls:

1. Enter individual values systematically, using the Enter key to separate entries
2. Provide clear instructions about value selection criteria
3. Ensure values align exactly with Zendesk's expectations
4. Include context about when each value should be used

### Advanced URL Configuration

For implementations requiring path parameters:

</Frame>

Path parameters become integral parts of the URL structure and require careful handling to ensure proper functionality. These parameters must be marked as required since they form essential components of the URL construction.

## Implementation Considerations

### Security Aspects

While redirect actions don't require direct API authentication, several security considerations remain important:

1. URL Parameter Validation
   - Implement proper encoding for all parameter values
   - Validate parameter content before inclusion
   - Consider length limitations for URL parameters

2. User Authorization
   - Ensure users have appropriate Zendesk access
   - Consider implementing additional authorization checks if needed
   - Monitor usage patterns for security anomalies

### Performance Optimization

Several factors contribute to optimal performance:

1. URL Construction Efficiency
   - Minimize parameter count to reduce URL length
   - Implement efficient parameter value generation
   - Consider caching frequently used values

2. Response Time Management
   - Monitor redirect timing metrics
   - Optimize parameter generation processes
   - Implement appropriate timeout handling

### User Experience Enhancement

Consider these aspects to provide an optimal user experience:

1. Parameter Population Clarity
   - Provide clear feedback about parameter values
   - Allow for user modification when needed
   - Maintain consistent parameter behavior

2. Error Handling
   - Implement clear error messages
   - Provide guidance for error resolution
   - Monitor common error patterns

## Implementation Testing

Comprehensive testing should include:

1. Functionality Verification
   - Test parameter population accuracy
   - Verify redirect behavior
   - Confirm field pre-population in Zendesk

2. Error Scenario Testing
   - Test invalid parameter combinations
   - Verify error handling mechanisms
   - Confirm user feedback systems

3. Performance Assessment
   - Measure response times
   - Verify behavior under load
   - Test various parameter combinations

## Maintenance Procedures

Establish regular maintenance practices:

1. Parameter Monitoring
   - Review parameter usage patterns
   - Update parameter descriptions as needed
   - Adjust value constraints based on feedback

2. Performance Tracking
   - Monitor redirect success rates
   - Track parameter population accuracy
   - Assess user satisfaction metrics

3. Documentation Management
   - Maintain current parameter documentation
   - Update user guides as needed
   - Document common issues and solutions

## Next Steps

After implementing the Zendesk ticket creation redirect action:

1. Create comprehensive user documentation
2. Establish monitoring systems
3. Define maintenance schedules
4. Plan future enhancements
5. Configure feedback collection mechanisms

This implementation provides a robust foundation for streamlined ticket creation while maintaining the flexibility and familiarity of the Zendesk interface. Regular monitoring and maintenance will ensure continued effectiveness and user satisfaction.
