## Issue

We are unable to fetch an access token for a required API scope. The error message displayed in the console should display the specific scope we're missing.

## Resolution

- Head to [https://admin.google.com/u/1/ac/owl/domainwidedelegation](https://admin.google.com/u/1/ac/owl/domainwidedelegation) and ensure the client ID displayed in the error message has been granted the specified API scope
- Also verify that the app with the same client ID is 'Trusted' here: [https://admin.google.com/ac/owl/list?tab=configuredApps](https://admin.google.com/ac/owl/list?tab=configuredApps).
