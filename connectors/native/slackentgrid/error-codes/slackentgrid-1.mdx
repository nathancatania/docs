title: SLACKENTGRID-1
description: SLACKENTGRID-1 Error Code
---

## Issue:

- Glean is unable to find the discovery token post-authentication for Slack Enterprise Grid.
- Glean is unable to reconcile the token from post-authorization internally assuming authorization succeeded.

## Resolution:

- Reattempt authorization. Ensure that authorization succeeds, i.e. redirects back to Glean after acknowledging the crawler app's permissions.
