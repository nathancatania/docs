## Issue:

- The Slack Team ID is invalid.

## Resolution:

- Please double check whether correct team ID is set up correctly and is valid. A valid team ID should start with a T and only has characters 0-9 and A-Z. You may follow these steps to find the team ID for your Slack
    - Open any web browser and log in to your Slack account
    - Go to your workspace main page and check the URL in the search bar at the top.
    - The URL looks like this: `https://app.slack.com/client/T...` The following numbers represent your team ID.
    - A valid team ID example would be `TAHE0J86K`
