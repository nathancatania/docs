## Issue:

- We do not have all the necessary OAuth scopes for GleanBot to work.

## Resolution:

- Navigate to [https://api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) and find your app created for the Glean integration.
- On the left hand side, navigate to OAuth & Permissions. Then scroll down to the Scopes section.

- Under Bot Token Scopes, select Add an OAuth Scope.
- From there, you can add the missing scopes listed that are needed for GleanBot to set up. The link will be something like: `https://api.slack.com/apps/XXXXX/oauth?`
