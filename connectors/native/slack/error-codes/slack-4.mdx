## Issue:

- An internal config setting is preventing any channel results, public or private, from showing up.

## Resolution:

- Admin should check the config keys for the slack instance: `promptForPrivateResults` and `crawlPublicChannels` cannot be set to false at the same time
- Reach out to us at [https://support.glean.com](https://support.glean.com) to diagnose why crawling public channels is disabled and/or why the private channel option is disabled.
