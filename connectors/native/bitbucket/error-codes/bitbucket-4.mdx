# Issue

For a Bitbucket Server instance, bitbucket.org is provided as the host name.

# Resolution

In "Bitbucket Server" case, the host name should correspond to the bitbucket server hosted in the customer's premises.

If your bitbucket host is indeed bitbucket.org, then please use the non-server "Bitbucket" as the datasource.
