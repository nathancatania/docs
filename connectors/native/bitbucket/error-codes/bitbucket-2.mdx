# Issue

We are unable to fetch Bitbucket repositories using the OAuth consumer credentials (cloud) or access token (server) that were provided.

# Resolution

### For Bitbucket Cloud:

Please ensure that the Bitbucket OAuth consumer was given the permissions "Account:Read" and "Account:Email".

### For Bitbucket Server:

Please ensure that the access token was given the permissions "Project: Read" and "Repository: Admin".
