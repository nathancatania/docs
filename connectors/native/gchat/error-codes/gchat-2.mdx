## Issue:

We are unable to fetch an access token for a required API scope. The error message displayed in the console should display the specific scope we're missing.

## Resolution:

- Head to [https://admin.google.com/ac/owl/domainwidedelegation](https://admin.google.com/ac/owl/domainwidedelegation) and ensure the client ID displayed in the error message has been granted the specified API scope
- For more information on the specified API scope: [https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize](https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/authenticate-authorize)
