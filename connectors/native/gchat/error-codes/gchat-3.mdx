description: GCHAT-3 Error Code

## Issue:

We are unable to make an API request for a required API scope. The error message displayed in the console should display the specific scope we're unable to validate.

## Resolution:

- Make sure the 'Google Chat API' is enabled for the Glean GCP Project in use. It can be enabled in the API Library. Head to `https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/chat.googleapis.com/overview?project=<glean-gcp-project-id>` to check.
    - If your Glean GCP project is Glean hosted, this step must be performed by your Glean representative.
- Once the API is enabled, you need to configure the app. Click on Manage and switch to the Configuration tab. If your Glean GCP project is Glean hosted, this step must be performed by your Glean representative. Fill out the fields as below:
    - App status: LIVE - available to users
    - App name: Glean
    - Avatar URL: `https://app.glean.com/images/admin/glean-logo2-256.png`
