description: SALESFORCE_3 Error Code
---

## Issue:

We require field level read permissions for some specific fields for each of the Salesforce objects that would be crawled. This error shows up when we detect that field level permissions were not set for a field.

## Resolution:

- For the profile/permission set of the authenticated user, navigate to `Field Level Mapping` and ensure that read permissions are set for the fields mentioned in the error message.
