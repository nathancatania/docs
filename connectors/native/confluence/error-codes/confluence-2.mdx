## Issue

- We are unable to fetch spaces from your Confluence instance.

## Resolution

- For Confluence Datacenter, please ensure the service account provided has the required permissions to fetch spaces. The service account should have VIEW access to spaces and pages within it (official documentation).

If you are using Confluence Cloud or still having difficulty, please reach out to us: [https://support.glean.com](https://support.glean.com)
