## Issue

- We are unable to fetch space permissions from your Confluence instance.

## Resolution:

- For Confluence Datacenter, please ensure the service account provided has the required permissions to fetch space permissions. The service account should have VIEW access to spaces that needs to be indexed (official documentation).

If you are using Confluence Cloud or still having difficulty, please reach out to us: [https://support.glean.com](https://support.glean.com)
