## Issue

- We are unable to validate if redlisted creators file is uploaded correctly.

## Resolution:

- Please ensure you've provided the redlisted creators file name you've provided exists in the sensitive configs bucket which is generally of the form:
`sensitive-config-${PROJECT_ID}`

- Please ensure that there is atleast one email added in the file. The file is a CSV, so an example would look like:
`foo@domain.com,bar@domain.com,baz@domain.com`

If you are still having difficulty, please reach out to us: [https://support.glean.com](https://support.glean.com)
