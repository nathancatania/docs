## Issue

- There are advanced user criterias in the ServiceNow instance and the current setup mode does not support advanced user criterias.
- Any permissioning schema that depends on these advanced user criterias will not be fully adhered to.
- For more information on advanced user criteria see this [article](https://www.servicenow.com/community/now-platform-blog/a-deep-dive-to-user-criteria/ba-p/2281285).

## Resolution

There are 2 options:

- Support advanced user criteria: Consider performing ServiceNow setup in Advanced mode (switch from Simple) to support advanced user criterias.
- Ignore advanced user criteria: If you accept the ramifications of being unable to adhere to permissions dependent on advanced user criterias, you can bypass the check by ticking the "Ignore present advanced user criterias" checkbox.
