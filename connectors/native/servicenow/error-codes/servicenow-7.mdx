## Issue

- ServiceNow knowledge article template fetches are enabled and Glean is unable to fetch the knowledge article template table as it likely does not exist.
## Resolution

- If your organization should not have knowledge article templates, set the config `enableTemplateFetch` to `false`.
- If your organization should have knowledge article templates, ensure they exist.
