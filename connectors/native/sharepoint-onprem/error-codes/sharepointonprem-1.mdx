## Issue

- We are unable to list site groups using the REST API for the given Sharepoint on-premises server site collection.

## Resolution

The provided user credentials must be an administrator of the configured site collection.

- Navigate to the owners page for the Sharepoint server: `http://<domain>/_admin/owners.aspx`. The page should look like the following (for domain `sp-onprem-2016` and site collection `/sites/TeamSiteCollection1`)

- Ensure the account used for authenticating via NTLM is a site collection administrator (listed in any of the above boxes).
- Double-check the username and password inputs.
