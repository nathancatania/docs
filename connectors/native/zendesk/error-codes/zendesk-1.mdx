description: ZENDESK_1 Error Code

## Issue:

- We are unable to parse the entered Zendesk domain.

## Resolution:

- The entered domain should follow either of these two formats:
    
    1. It may or may not start with "https://", should be followed by a subdomain, and should end with ".zendesk.com" with an optional trailing slash, or,
    2. It can only be the subdomain, without any whitespace, dots, or forward slashes.
