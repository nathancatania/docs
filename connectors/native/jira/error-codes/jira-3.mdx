## Issue:

- We are unable to fetch users from the product access groups entered

## Resolution:

- For Jira Data Center, please ensure that the product access groups entered are correct and the service account provided has the relevant permissions. The service account needs to have Administer Jira Global permissions for our crawler to work. ([official documentation](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/managing-global-permissions-938847142.html))
- For Jira Cloud, please download the crawler app from [here](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1227152/glean-search-crawler-for-jira-data-center?tab=overview&hosting=datacenter)
