description: JIRA_2 Error Code

## Issue:

- We are unable to fetch projects from the Jira instance

## Resolution:

- For Jira Data Center, please ensure that the service account has the relevant permissions to fetch projects. The service account needs to have Administer Jira Global permissions for our crawler to work. ([official documentation](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/managing-global-permissions-938847142.html))
