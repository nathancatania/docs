## Issue:

- Failed to validate Glean webhook registration. Webhooks are important for keeping the data fresh and providing the best Glean experience.

## Resolution:

- For Jira Data Center, please ensure that the service account has the relevant permissions to register a webhook. The service account needs to have Administer Jira Global permissions for our crawler to work. ([official documentation](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/managing-global-permissions-938847142.html))
- For Jira Data Center, please ensure that the webhook created is not disabled. Official documentation on how to check this.
