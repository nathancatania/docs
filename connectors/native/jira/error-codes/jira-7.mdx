## Issue:

- Glean is unable to fetch projects from your Jira Cloud instance.

## Resolution:

- For Jira Cloud, please download the crawler app from [here](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1222715/glean-crawler-for-jira?tab=overview&hosting=cloud)
- Ensure that the role atlassian-addons-project-access has Administer Projects permissions for all the projects. This happens automatically when you install the crawler app.

For additional assistance, please contact Glean Support at [https://support.glean.com](https://support.glean.com)
