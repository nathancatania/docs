## Issue

We couldn't find a Google Drive connector instance connected to Glean that has the same domain as the Google Groups connector. We use this to fetch permissions for Google Groups documents.

## Resolution

Make sure that Google Drive for the same domain is connected to Glean. Additionally, if this is connected, ensure there is at least one group created.
