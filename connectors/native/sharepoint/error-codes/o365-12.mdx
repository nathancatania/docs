## Issue:

- We are missing Sites.Selected permissions for a specified webUrl in the greenlist.

## Resolution:

These steps require being either a tenant administrator, or a site administrator of the associated site collection.

- Open a PowerShell session. Note these steps may also require you to install Sharepoint PowerShell.

```
Connect-PnPOnline -Url $SITE_COLLECTION_URL
```

### For certificate self-serve setup (recommended)

```
Grant-PnpAzureADAppSitePermission -AppId '$CLIENT_ID' -Site $SITE_COLLECTION_URL -Permissions FullControl
```

### For client secret-based setup (deprecated)

```
Grant-PnpAzureADAppSitePermission -AppId '$CLIENT_ID' -Site $SITE_COLLECTION_URL -Permissions FullControl
```

You should expect the output to include

```
Id    : <id>
Roles : {read}
Apps  : {ReadPermissions, $CLIENT_ID_FOR_SETUP}
```

If the output does not include the right application ID with ReadPermissions, rerun:

```
Grant-PnpAzureADAppSitePermission -AppId '$CLIENT_ID' -Site $SITE_COLLECTION_URL -Permissions Read
```
