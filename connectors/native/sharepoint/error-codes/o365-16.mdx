## Issue

The certificate and private key uploaded is incompatible with the associated application. Either:

- The private key uploaded was not used to sign the certificate,
- The private key is not in `PKCS#8` format (e.g. starts with `BEGIN PRIVATE KEY` as opposed to `BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY`), and/or
- The certificate was not uploaded to the Azure portal.

## Resolution

- Regenerate the certificate and private key:
    ```
    openssl genrsa -out tempprivatekey.key 2048
    openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -outform PEM -in tempprivatekey.key -out privatekey.key -nocrypt
    openssl req -new -key privatekey.key -out request.csr
    openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in request.csr -signkey privatekey.key -out certificate.crt
    ```

- Upload the certificate to the associated Azure application.
    - Navigate to App Registrations and click on your created application.
    - Then, under Manage, navigate to Certificates & secrets and upload the certificate (certificate.crt)
