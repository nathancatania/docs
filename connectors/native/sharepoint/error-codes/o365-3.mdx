## Issue:

- We are missing `Files.Read.All` or `Sites.Read.All` permission for the app.

## Resolution:

- Please navigate to the Azure portal. Select Azure Active Directory, then navigate to Enterprise applications and find the app you setup for Glean.
- Please ensure that you entered the correct Client secret, Application (client) ID, and Directory (tenant) ID in the console.
- Please ensure this App has the permissions `Files.Read.All`, `Sites.Read.All`, and that admin consent has been granted for both. 

**To Grant Admin Consent:**

- Ensure you are signed into Azure as a Global, Application or Cloud Application Administrator.
- Use the search box to navigate to Enterprise applications. Select the Glean app you just created from the list of applications.
- Click on Permissions under Security. Review the permissions shown, and then click Grant admin consent.
