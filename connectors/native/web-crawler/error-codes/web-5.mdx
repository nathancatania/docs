The canonicalization configs set are inconsistent. Contact Glean support to help with fixing this. Some common errors are:

- The conflicting configs`urlCanonicalization.stripAllQueryParams` and `urlCanonicalization.greenlistedQueryParams` are both set. Remove one of the two depending on the desired behaviour.
- `canonicalizingURLRegexes` contains an odd sized list of elements. It is expected to contain an even-sized list of matching group and corresponding replacement pairs.
