## Getting Started

Access the data sources management interface by navigating to the [admin console](https://app.glean.com/admin) (click the wrench icon in the left-hand navigation menu). You'll land on the **Data Sources** page by default.

## Monitoring Data Sources

The data sources page provides an overview of all your connected sources and their current status. 

<Info>
Status indicators like crawl status, document count, and content crawl may not always reflect real-time information. When you see "Crawl in progress", content should still be searchable as long as:
- There is a document count displayed
- The data source is set as visible
</Info>

<Warning>
If content isn't appearing in search results despite meeting these conditions, please submit a support ticket.
</Warning>

## Setting Up New Data Sources

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Data Source">
    Click the "Add data source" button to view available native connectors. You can add:
    - Pre-configured data sources with native connectors
    - Custom websites
    - [Custom data sources](/articles/6742862-setting-up-a-custom-data-source)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Settings">
    Provide necessary credentials and configurations for crawling. You can save your progress and resume setup later.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Manage Data">
    Define rules to control what content Glean can crawl:
    - Set inclusion/exclusion rules
    - Configure content type filters
    - Customize crawling parameters
    
    <Info>This step becomes available after saving the initial setup.</Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Crawling">
    Choose to either:
    - Start crawling immediately
    - Schedule crawling for later (can be initiated from the Get Started tab under Review Data Source Crawl)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Visibility Controls

<Card title="Best Practices for New Data Sources">
1. Initially set visibility to "Visible to test group only"
2. Configure your test group through the [Manage test group](https://app.glean.com/admin/setup/apps/testing) option
3. Let the test group verify search results and content accuracy
4. Once verified, set visibility to "visible to everyone"
</Card>

### Content Overview

Clicking into a specific data source reveals detailed information about:
- Crawl status
- Content indexing progress
- Document types (e.g., for Dropbox):
  - `Folder`
  - `Document`
  - `Spreadsheet`
  - `Paper`
  - `Video`

## Advanced Configuration

### Managing Data Rules

Some data sources (like Google Drive) offer a dedicated "Manage Data" tab for advanced configuration options:
- Define inclusion/exclusion rules
- Set content type filters
- Configure crawling parameters

<Info>
If you need custom configurations for data sources without a "Manage Data" tab, contact support or your Glean representative. We continuously expand self-service configuration options.
