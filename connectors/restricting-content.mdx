### Configuration Process

The implementation of content restrictions involves two main approaches:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Greenlisting Implementation" icon="circle-check">
    Create an allowlist of data sources or items that should be included in search results. Only these specified items will be:
    - Crawled by Glean's systems
    - Indexed in the search database
    - Available in search results
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Redlisting Implementation" icon="circle-xmark">
    Create a blocklist of data sources or items that should be excluded from search results. These specified items will be:
    - Excluded from Glean's crawling process
    - Omitted from the search index
    - Hidden from all search results
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  Different connectors may support different types of content restrictions. For connector-specific restriction capabilities, refer to the **Restricting Content** documentation for your specific connector.
