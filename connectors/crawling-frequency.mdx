## Overview

The Glean crawling system implements a sophisticated approach to data retrieval and indexing. The system is built around two primary optimization goals:

1. Minimizing latency when incorporating updates from source applications
2. Maintaining API call volumes within acceptable limits to prevent source application overload

## Configuration Flexibility

<Info>
All crawling frequencies described in this documentation represent default settings based on customer feedback. These values can be customized to meet specific organizational needs.
</Info>

Organizations can fine-tune their crawling configuration in several ways:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="API Call Rate Management" icon="gauge">
    Administrators can configure:
    - The rate of API calls per second
    - The number of concurrent API calls
    - Dynamic exponential backoff parameters for handling overload scenarios
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Time-Based Controls" icon="clock">
    The system supports granular scheduling with different rates for:
    - Peak operational hours
    - Off-peak periods
    - Specific days of the week
    - Custom time windows
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Core Concepts

<ResponseField name="Full Content Crawl" type="Definition">
  A comprehensive process that indexes the entire corpus of a datasource. These crawls are scheduled at regular intervals to ensure complete dataset accuracy in the search index.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Incremental Content Crawl" type="Definition">
  An efficient update strategy that focuses on modified or newly added content since the previous crawl, optimizing resource usage by avoiding full repository scans.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="People Data" type="Definition">
  Organizational information about individuals, encompassing names, titles, email addresses, departmental affiliations, and other relevant attributes.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Identity Crawl" type="Definition">
  A specialized process for retrieving and updating identity-related information across various datasources.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Activity Crawl" type="Definition">
  A continuous monitoring process that tracks and indexes specific changes within a datasource, including content additions, updates, deletions, and permission modifications.
</ResponseField>

## Content Deletion Handling

<Info>
Glean handles content deletion through two primary mechanisms, depending on the capabilities of the source application.
</Info>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="API/Webhook Deletion" icon="webhook">
    For applications that provide deletion notifications through APIs or webhooks, content is removed from the index immediately upon notification.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Full Crawl Cleanup" icon="broom">
    For applications without deletion notifications, stale content is identified and removed during scheduled full crawls.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
Deletion of derived information used in models and other auxiliary systems is governed by Glean's privacy policy.
</Warning>

## Support for Real-time Updates

<Card title="Webhook Integration">
Many modern platforms support webhook-based updates, enabling near real-time content synchronization. For example:

- GitHub/GitLab: Updates within 5 minutes of changes
- Slack: Near immediate updates via webhook
- Confluence: 5-minute update window for newer versions
</Card>

<Note>
For datasources that don't support webhooks, Glean implements regular polling with optimized intervals to maintain data freshness while respecting API limits.
