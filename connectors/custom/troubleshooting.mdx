This article reviews helpful debug endpoints you can use to investigate indexing API issues. For a comprehensive document on the different endpoints available for debugging, please review this [troubleshooting document](https://developers.glean.com/docs/indexing_api/indexing_api_troubleshooting/). If you require further assistance debugging, the Next Steps section describes what information to share with Glean Support when raising a ticket.

## Debug Data Source Status
### Documentation [Link](https://developers.glean.com/indexing/tag/Troubleshooting/paths/~1debug~1%7Bdatasource%7D~1status/post/)

<CodeGroup>
```bash Request
curl -i -X POST \
  'https://domain-be.glean.com/api/index/v1/debug/{datasource}/status' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN_HERE>'
```
</CodeGroup>

### When to Use

If you want to confirm whether your indexing job was successful, you can use this endpoint to verify if your documents have been uploaded and indexed. The **bulkUploadHistory** will show the details of your document indexing endpoint time. After documents are uploaded, they will be queued for processing. New documents will be available in search results when the **processingHistory** timestamp is after the **bulkUploadHistory**.

## Debug Data Source Document
### Documentation [Link](https://developers.glean.com/indexing/tag/Troubleshooting/paths/~1debug~1%7Bdatasource%7D~1document/post/)

<CodeGroup>
```bash Request
curl -i -X POST \
  'https://domain-be.glean.com/api/index/v1/debug/{datasource}/document' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN_HERE>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8' \
  -d '{
    "objectType": "Article",
    "docId": "art123"
  }'
```
</CodeGroup>

### When to Use

If a user reports a missing document, this endpoint can be used to confirm if a document is present in the data source index and verify what permissions this document has. A user will be able to view a document if any of the below criteria is met:

- **allowAnonymousAccess** is **true**
- **allowAllDatasourceUsersAccess** is **true** and user has been indexed as a user of the data source
- user is a member of the **allowedGroups** and in the list of **allowedUsers** OR **allowedGroupIntersections**

## Debug Data Source User
### Documentation [Link](https://developers.glean.com/indexing/tag/Troubleshooting/paths/~1debug~1%7Bdatasource%7D~1user/post/)

<CodeGroup>
```bash Request
curl -i -X POST \
  'https://domain-be.glean.com/api/index/v1/debug/{datasource}/user' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN_HERE>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8' \
  -d '{
    "email": "u1@foo.com"
  }'
```
</CodeGroup>

### When to Use

This endpoint can be used along with debug data source document to confirm if a user is in the group(s) provisioned to have access to the document.

## Check Document Access
### Documentation [Link](https://developers.glean.com/indexing/tag/Troubleshooting/paths/~1checkdocumentaccess/post/)

<CodeGroup>
```bash Request
curl -i -X POST \
  https://domain-be.glean.com/api/index/v1/checkdocumentaccess \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN_HERE>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "datasource": "string",
    "objectType": "string",
    "docId": "string",
    "userEmail": "string"
  }'
```
</CodeGroup>
