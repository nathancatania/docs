Setting up a custom data source allows you to give Glean custom information to index, even when a native data source isn't supported. For example, if your company has an internal tool you'd like to connect to Glean, you can do that by setting it up as a custom data source.

<Note>
If you'd like to set up a custom data source, please reach out to your account executive or customer success manager at Glean.

## Create a Data Source 

To set up a custom data source, Admins can navigate to [admin console]() > [Data sources](https://app.glean.com/admin/setup/apps).

Click on the "Add data source" button in the top right corner. In the modal that appears, click on "Custom" at the bottom of the list.

When setting up a custom data source, you can customize details including:

- Name of the data source 
- How results for this data source appear (including the icon that teammates see)
- Quick actions teammates can take directly from the Glean Home or New Tab Page

A number of advanced settings are also available, including the ability to further specify how search result titles and URLs appear, object types for the app, and customize filters for the app. You can find more information on options in the [Glean Developer Documentation](https://developers.glean.com/indexing/tag/Datasources/paths/~1adddatasource/post/).

We strongly recommend working with your account executive or customer success manager at Glean to ensure your custom data source is set up correctly. Please reach out to us with any questions!
