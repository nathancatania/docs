##### Our goal

At Glean, our mission is to bring people the knowledge they need to make a difference in the world. This includes empowering individuals with disabilities by incorporating accessibility throughout our products and services. That's why we've started an initiative to bring our web application into compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

##### Our approach

Glean's design process incorporates accessibility principles from the start. Our accessibility champions collaborate with our product and engineering teams throughout the development process. Our testing involves a variety of assistive technologies, including screen readers, magnifiers, and alternative navigation methods such as keyboard-only and voice control.

##### Get in touch

We welcome any questions or feedback at [a11y@glean.com](mailto:a11y@glean.com). You can also chat with us directly from Glean using the Messenger. Please include information about the site, web application, desktop application, or mobile apps you're trying to access and the assistive technology you're using (e.g., NVDA with Chrome on Windows, VoiceOver with Firefox on Mac OS, etc...).
