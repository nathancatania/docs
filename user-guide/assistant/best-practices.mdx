This guide outlines best practices for interacting with Glean Chat, AI apps, and Search to ensure you receive the most accurate and relevant results.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use Question Marks">
    Always conclude questions with a question mark (?). This punctuation helps Glean recognize that you're seeking information or clarification.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Specify Connector Names">
    Include the relevant connector name in your question for more precise results. 
    
    For example, instead of:
    "Provide me some sample support tickets"
    
    Use:
    "Can you provide me some sample support tickets from Zendesk?"

  </Step>

  <Step title="Utilize Connector Parameters">
    For global searches, use connector names as search parameters to find specific results. Use the format `app:connectorname` (e.g., "app:zendesk" or "app:gdrive").

## Additional Best Practices

<Card title="Use Clear Language" icon="language">
  Write questions in clear, simple language and avoid slang or abbreviations.

  **Instead of:**
  "What's the ROI on implementing AI-driven CRM?"

  **Better:**
  "Could you explain the expected benefits of using AI in customer relationship management systems?"
</Card>

<Card title="Break Down Complex Questions" icon="layer-group">
  If your question involves multiple parts, consider breaking it down into smaller, more focused questions to get more accurate responses.
</Card>

<Card title="Provide Context" icon="circle-info">
  Include relevant background information to help Glean understand your question better and provide more relevant answers.
</Card>

<Card title="Use Quotation Marks for Emphasis" icon="quote-left">
  Place important keywords in double quotes to emphasize them in your search. For example:
  `Please provide recent customer tickets for the "XYZ" customer from the ticketing tool or datasource "ABC".`
