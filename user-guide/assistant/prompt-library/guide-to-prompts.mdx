Welcome to the Glean Prompt Library! This new feature enables you to create and discover Prompts that unlock more powerful ways to use Glean Chat.

## Discovering and running Prompts

You can browse and search for Prompts shared by your teammates in the Prompt Library.  When you select a Prompt:

* You'll see the instructions that your teammate crafted for the Prompt. You can use the instructions as-is or customize them for your own needs.
* You may see placeholders for fields marked in blue. Click on the placeholder to enter additional information necessary to run the Prompt.
* If you'd like to get quick access to the Prompt in the future, click on the heart icon in the top right to add it to the Favorites section of the Prompt Library.

## Create your own Prompt

If there's a task that you'd like to automate, you can create your own Prompt by clicking on the **Create Prompt** button in the top right of the Prompt Library.  This will open the Prompt Editor:

* Create a descriptive title for your Prompt.
* Write instructions for how Glean Chat should execute your Prompt.
* You can create fields in the Prompt by enclosing them in double brackets [[ ]].  For example:Show me the latest updates for [[Project Name]]
* The field will automatically get marked in blue in the instructions and will be automatically added to the **Fields** section above the instructions.
* You can test your Prompt by entering values for the fields and clicking on the **Run** button.
* By default, the Prompt is **only visible to you**. If your company allows you to share the Prompt, you can change it to **Visible to everyone** so that it will appear in the Prompt Library for all of your teammates.
* Click on **Save Prompt** when you're finished.â€‹
