## Using AI Answers

AI Answers works best with natural language queries that express what you want to know. Instead of using keyword searches, phrase your questions as you would ask a colleague.

<Card title="Example Queries" icon="message-question">
Instead of searching for `expense policy`, try asking: `How much can I expense on a hotel?`


This natural language approach helps Glean understand your intent and provide more relevant, detailed responses.
