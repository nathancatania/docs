## Usage Scenarios

### Adding to Existing Code
<Steps>
  <Step title="Situation">
    An engineer needs to create a new evalset, working with code spread across multiple files and languages. They need to leverage existing code rather than starting from scratch.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Example Queries">
    - "How do I add a new search evalset?"
    - "How to create a new autocomplete evalset for history suggestions?"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Outcome">
