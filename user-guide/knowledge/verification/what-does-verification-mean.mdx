**Verification** is your stamp of approval on the accuracy of a document you own.

By letting your teammates know your document is verified to be accurate, they can use the information in their work with confidence.​

## For example

An engineer can **verify a tech plan,**so other engineers from different teams can input on the latest decisions with any dependencies or considerations.​A product manager can **verify** **the release notes of a feature**, so Sales and Support teams can use that information in conversations with prospective and current customers.

A designer can **verify a design proposal,**so engineers know it contains the most up-to-date requirements and designs for a feature they're building.

And many more! Get in touch via the Messenger with any questions or share use cases of your own.
