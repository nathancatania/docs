title: Organizing Collections using Headers
description: How to use Headers to create subsections in Collections
---

Collections are an easy way to organize related documents across all your tools and any URL from the web by a single topic. As teams start creating Collections with more than a few items, it can become harder for people to navigate and find the most relevant or important item within the Collection. Here's how you can use Headers to better organize.

## What are Headers?

Headers are used to label different sections within a Collection to provide more context on a group of documents. For example, you can use headers to:

* Group documents by order of importance using "Start here" "Must reads"
* Group documents by different projects
* Group documents by topics such as "Onboarding" "Technical resources" "Project backgrounds"

## How to create Headers

You can create headers the same way you add any documents and links by clicking on the **+ Add** button on the top right corner of the Collection. You can also insert Headers between existing documents or add Headers to the bottom of the page by clicking the **+---**button from the place you want to add headers to. ****

If you are looking for ways to organize by creating hierarchy of information, you can use [Subcollections]() to create Collections within a Collection.
