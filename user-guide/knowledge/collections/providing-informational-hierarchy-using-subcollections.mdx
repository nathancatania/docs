title: Providing informational hierarchy using Subcollections
description: How to create Collections within a Collection
---

[Collections](https://help.glean.com/en/articles/5269660-how-collections-work) are an easy way to organize related documents across all your tools and any URL from the web by a single topic. As teams start creating Collections with more than a few items, it can become harder for people to navigate and find the most relevant or important item within the Collection. Here's how you can use Subcollections to better organize.

## What are SubCollections?

SubCollections are nested collections under a main collection, providing ways to build a more robust collection with a large number of items. It prevents a single collection from being too long to navigate even with Headers, while also providing informational hierarchy. For example, you can create a subcollection for

* Subteams, subtopics, or subprojects under the main Collection for a team or topic. For example, creating a subcollection for a product feature within a Collection for a product team
* When there are different audiences under the same umbrella topics. i.e. creating a subcollection for BDR and AE under "Onboarding" header/topic
* When you have more than 5 items (documents and links) under the same topic, making it too long to be organized under a HeaderWe also encourage organizing using subcollection when the main collection becomes a list of 20+ documents and links.

See a demo of Subcollections [here](https://www.loom.com/share/5969473e092d4779b5655bae5fa181f2)

## How to create SubCollections

You can create a Subcollection the same way you add any documents and links to a collection by clicking "+ Add New Collection" button on the top right corner of the Collection. You can also insert Subcollection between existing documents or add to the bottom of the page by clicking the **+---**button from the place you want to add a Subcollection to. ****

## Moving SubCollections

Collections can be nested under other Collections by clicking on the 3-dot menu on the Collections dashboard and selecting "Move" and moving the Collection to an appropriate parent Collection. Please note that there can only be one parent Collection for every Subcollection.

## Accessing Subcollections

* See SubCollections in search resultsSubcollection will appear on the search results based on relevancyWhen a document is part of a SubCollection, you'll see the SubCollection on the search result
* SubCollection will not appear on the main Collections dashboard in order to help organization of the dashboard

## Number of Subcollections

You can create up to 20 Collections within a collection and up to 2 sublevels (Main Collection -> sub collections -> collection within a sub collection) for a 3 layer of Collections hierarchy
