Collections are an easy way to organize related documents across all your tools and any URL from the web by a single topic. When you want to use Collections as a source of truth on a particular topic, you may want to restrict which teammates can edit contents of that Collection. Here's how you can control who has edit access over a single Collection.

## Who Can Change Permissions

1. **Owners:**Owners can add or remove other owners and editors, ensuring that the right people have the appropriate level of access.The creator of a collection is automatically assigned as the Owner and has the ability to manage permissions.The company's overall Collection Moderator has Owner rights to all Collections by default. ​
2. **Editors:**Editors can add or remove other editors from the Collection

**Note:** All Collections will always be viewable by the entire company. You can restrict any individual from viewing a specific Collection.

## How Permissions on Child Collections Work

Child Collections (Collections created under a top parent Collection) automatically inherit the permissions of their parent Collection. This means:

* **Inherited Permissions**: Any permissions set on the parent Collection will apply to the child Collection. ​
* **Adding Permissions**: Owners and editors of the child Collection can add new editors or owners to the child collection.​
* **Non-Removable Inherited Permissions**: Inherited permissions cannot be removed from the child collection.​[](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/1101933699/fb22c37b4a013c0d6f5c18ea/image.png?expires=1736488800&signature=3d2576c655ee009238d278f634fbd209006dfeff1b0c89f553362ddf103559e3&req=dSEnF8B9nodWUPMW1HO4zQaUxRb9jQcUoLvRVSVDgauR1XwUeTo%2F2SmaLcjS%0A5hl3%0A)
