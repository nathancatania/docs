title: Unlisted Go Links

Unlisted Go Links are Go Links that are only visible to the creator of the Go Link and admins of Glean. Unlisted Go Links are great for private projects you don't want others to accidentally discover.

### How to create an Unlisted Go Link

* Click on "**New Go Link**" on your [Go Links dashboard](https://app.glean.com/knowledge/golinks) or on the Glean Home page
* Fill out the form with a URL, name, and the description
* Check "**Unlist**"

Your Go Link will no longer be discoverable on the Go Links dashboard by other users. A user who knows the Go Link and types it directly into the address bar can still access the Go Link.

To make an unlisted Go Link discoverable to others again, simply uncheck the "**Unlist**."
