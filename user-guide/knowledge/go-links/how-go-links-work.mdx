## What are Go Links?

Go Links are a way to create short memorable links for important URLs at your company in the form of **go/link.**Go Links act like a mental bookmark: once you see it or hear it, you immediately know how to access it, both now and in the future.

For example, you could create **go/401k**for your company's 401k portal, **go/it-help** for your IT help desk, or **go/sprint-planning** for your Jira project. Glean also supports [Variable Go Links](https://help.glean.com/en/articles/6203607-creating-variable-go-links) and [appending Go Links](https://help.glean.com/en/articles/6473242-appending-go-links) that allows you to access hundreds of specific destinations using a single Go Link.

***Important:***

*Go Links are supported via the**[Glean browser extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/glean/cfpdompphcacgpjfbonkdokgjhgabpij)**or via DNS redirection.*

*If you have the extension installed, you'll see a prompt to grant permissions at the top of [Tools > Go Links](https://app.glean.com/knowledge/golinks). If you'd like to set up DNS-based Go Links redirection, Please contact our Sales or Customer Success team.*

## How to create a Go Link

1. Paste the URL you'd like this Go Link to redirect to under Destination URL.
2. Name the Go Link (what appears after **go/____**).
3. Add an optional description of what the link refers to so it's easier to maintain over time.

The name of a Go Link must be unique and is limited to **letters, numbers, dashes, underscores, colons, periods, ampersands, and forward slashes.**

When you navigate to a Go Link, we'll ignore dashes and underscores. This helps people get to the right destination even if they don't remember the exact Go Link name.

For example, **go/q4-goals**, **go/q4_goals**, and **go/q4goals** will all take you to the same destination. Note that this means that if **go/q4-goals**already exists, you won't be able to create **go/q4goals**, **go/q4-goals_**, etc.

A Go Link is editable by everyone by default. If needed, you can restrict edit access by checking**Restrict edit access only to me** under **More options**. After creating a Go Link, it will appear on the dashboard.

## Ways to create Go Links

### 1. Go Links Dashboard

Go to [Tools > Go Links](https://app.glean.com/knowledge/golinks) and click on the **New Go Link**button in the top right.

### 2. Glean home page

Create a new Go Link via the**"New"** button in the top right.

### 3. Search result

You can also create a Go Link by clicking on the three-dot button that appears when hovering over a search result.

### 4. Glean sidebar

If you have the browser extension installed, create Go Links for the webpage you're on. Open the sidebar using the shortcut **Command+J**for Mac and**Alt+J**for Windows. If the page already has a Go Link, you will see it there.

### 5. Error page

If you misspell a Go Link or type for a Go Link that doesn't exist, you will land on an error page letting you know a link was not found. You'll have the option to create a Go Link on that page.

## Using Go Links

**To use Go links, you must have the [Glean browser extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/glean/cfpdompphcacgpjfbonkdokgjhgabpij) installed or set up DNS-based redirection.**

If using the extension, you must also **allow the extension to redirect Go Links**. If you have the extension installed, you'll see a prompt to grant permissions at the top of [Tools > Go Links](https://app.glean.com/knowledge/golinks).

Simply type your Go Link in the browser URL bar (e.g. **go/onboarding**), and you'll get automatically redirected to the corresponding URL.

## Sharing Go Links

Simply copy and paste a Go Link to share via email and Slack. You can also tell people verbally to go to **go/onboarding.**

In Slack, the Glean slackbot will automatically unfurl Go Links in any public channel.

If there is a Go Link(s) for a document, you'll also see it reflected next to the document title on Glean search results.
