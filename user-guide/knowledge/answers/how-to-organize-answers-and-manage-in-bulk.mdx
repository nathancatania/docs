title: How to organize Answers and manage in bulk
---

Answers are bite-sized chunks of information you create in Glean to answer common questions your teammates - and future teammates - might have. Because Answers are often specific to projects, teams, and departments, grouping Answer cards in a Board makes it easy to manage them in bulk.

## What is an Answer Board?

Answer Boards allow users to organize and group Answer cards by a specific topic or team. Instead of managing permissions by individual Answers, users will be able to manage edit and view permissions in bulk on the Board level. **We recommend all Answers to be part of Board for best management and user experience.**

## How to create a Board

Users can create a Board by clicking the "New Board" button from the main Answers Board

## Adding Answers to a Board

You can add to Answers to an existing Board while creating an Answer using the drop-down "Add to Board"

You can also add existing Answers to a Board by clicking 3 dots and choosing "Move to Board"

## Managing Board permission

For each Board, you can specify editors and audience in order to control who can edit or view Answers within a Board. You can choose individuals or departments.

## How to best use Answer Boards

We encourage making a Board based on teams or projects that share admins or creators. For example, an HR team can manage a Board dedicated to frequent FAQs such as company benefits while Engineering team leaders can manage a Board based on product or system ownership.
