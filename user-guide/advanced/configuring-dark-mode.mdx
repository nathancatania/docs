Glean supports dark mode across its desktop and mobile applications to allow users to tailor their experience. This guide will help you understand what options Glean provides, as well as how to configure them.

By default, Glean will mirror your system's settings. When your computer or phone is set to dark mode, Glean will also be in dark mode. You can also set Glean to remain in dark mode or light mode by navigating to [your settings](https://app.glean.com/settings) and selecting the appropriate option. Glean applies these preferences across its desktop, [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.glean.app) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/glean-work/id1582892407) apps. You can change these settings at any time.
