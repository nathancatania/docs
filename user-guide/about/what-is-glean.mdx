### We‚Äôre here to expand human potential to do extraordinary work.

Humans are capable of incredible things because we can learn, share, and build upon existing knowledge. Knowing past context and the latest insights helps us generate new ideas and move faster. Imagine what we could do if all the knowledge we needed was at our fingertips?

That's why we created Glean.

Glean is the full-stack enterprise AI platform that connects with and deeply understands all your company's data, to bring you the answers you need. It's like having an expert who's been at your company since the very beginning, read every document, been part of every conversation, knows every employee's expertise, and is ready to assist you 24/7.

Glean powers your work. Not just your productivity, but your deep satisfaction knowing that you're making real progress. Because when you can find the answers you need‚Äî or the people who know even more‚Äî you can focus on your real work. And ultimately make a difference in the world.
