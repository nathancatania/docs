description: Get results from workplace apps in your browser history
---

With the [Glean Extension](/user-guide/apps/installing-the-browser-extension), you can see results and suggestions from certain workplace apps in your browser history.

Because these are history-based results, you will only be able to view content you've seen before in these workplace apps. Glean will search across the titles of the pages you've visited.

Results from your browser history are completely secure and private to you. Only you will see these results. Your coworkers and company will not see these results.

You will be able to see results from these workplace apps if they appear in your browser history:
