#### Controlling automatic updates

We provide system preferences to control automatic updates. You can disable automatic updates on a per-user basis. This may be helpful for testing new versions of the app before releasing them, or for gradually rolling out app updates. To maintain app reliability and security, we recommend updating Glean whenever a new app version is released.

To prevent Glean from automatically checking for updates, run the following terminal command as each user who will be running the Glean desktop app:

Use the following command to re-enable automatic updates:

By default, automatic updates will be enabled.
