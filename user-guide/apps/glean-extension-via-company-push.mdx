## What is Glean?

Glean is the AI-powered workplace assistant that searches all of your apps across your entire company, understanding context, language behavior, and relationships with others, to find personalized answers to all your workplace questions. You can read more about what we do and how to use us [here](https://help.glean.com/en/articles/3614014-what-is-glean).

## How did Glean become my new tab page?

The Glean extension was installed into your browser by your company which has vetted the product's effectiveness, security, and ability to save you time.

## How can I get my old new tab page back?

Although the Glean new tab page is an essential part of finding what you need from all your tools and quickly accessing relevant content, we understand sometimes you just want your old new tab back.

#### I want to go back to my old blank browser new tab:

After you log in to Glean, on the home or new tab page, click the **Home page** **settings icon** in the top right corner to open the settings panel. From there, you can turn off Glean as your new tab entirely by flipping the toggle.

#### I want to go back to my previous custom new tab (e.g. Momentum, Scratchpad, Earth View):

If you had a previous extension that replaced your new tab and prefer that over Glean, you'll have to uninstall the extension that gave you that previous new tab experience (Momentum, Scratchpad, Earth View, etc). Then, reinstall that same extension and your previous new tab should be restored.

#### How can I continue to use Glean?

After you've reset your new tab, don't forget that there are other entry points for Glean!
