title: Setting up Team Pages
---

It can be hard to coordinate efforts between groups of people at your company, and Glean's teams pages are here to help. These pages provide a single hub for people at your company to learn about who's working together, and what they're working on. This help article will guide you through the process of setting up teams; for more information on how to use team pages, see [this article](https://help.glean.com/en/articles/6687811-how-to-use-team-pages). *Note:* *Only admins and users with team moderator permissions can set up teams.*

Users can access teams pages through search, by clicking on teams in user profiles, and by visiting the team directory. All members of a team will be able to edit that page, including its name, description, profile photo, banner photo, contact information and which members are listed as leads on the team page.

Users can be in multiple teams at once. That way, one person can be in a team for their department, the DevOps pod they're working in and an employee resource group they're a part of. Glean recommends – at a minimum – setting up teams pages for every department. After that, we see additional value from creating teams that match your company's internal structure

Once you have teams set up in your organization, Glean recommends enlisting individual team leads to update their teams' contents, including photos, descriptions, and preferred contact methods. (Those leads are welcome to delegate those tasks as necessary, but they have the best context for what to create.) From there, users should begin seeing the teams pages as they use Glean normally.

## Setup process:

To create a new team, go to the team dashboard in Glean's Directory tab. Click on the "new team" button in the upper right-hand corner, and then follow the prompts to go about creating teams from there.

We currently support creating teams from two sources:

* **Slack**: All public slack channels connected to the Glean instance can be used to create teams where all channel members will be part of the team.
* **People data in Glean**: You can also create teams from eligible fields (e.g. department, role, location, and/or team) in your company's people data. This data is typically populated from your single sign-on system, such as Google Workspace, Okta or Azure Active Directory.You can use multiple people data fields to create teams, so your company can have pages based on departments, locations and other facets.

While not recommended, Glean also supports manually creating teams through our Push API. For more information on that, contact your customer success manager.

Once a team has been created in the teams dashboard, it may take up to an hour to appear in search results for all users. In the meantime, admins can view all teams (including those queued for creation) on the teams dashboard.

The teams dashboard supports the following functions:

* Searching for a team by name
* Filtering for a team based on department or business unit
* Ordering teams based on name, data source (e.g Slack, people data in Glean), created from (for Slack this is the channel name, for people fields this is the field name), and last updated (the last time a team page has been edited)Note that all teams being created or deleted will show up first in the dashboard while Glean is processing them.
* Bulk deletion of teams
