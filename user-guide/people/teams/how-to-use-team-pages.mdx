description: Here's how to get the most out of your team's page

Glean's team pages provide you and other employees at your company with a shared space to coordinate your efforts. Each page allows you to share what your team is working on, who's on that team, and what the best way is to contact you. This way, it is easier for you to work within your team and share information across functions at your organization.

At a minimum, Glean recommends creating team pages for all of your company's departments, but the possibilities for what team pages you have are limitless! Customers use team pages to create workspaces for individual project pods, employee resource groups and social groups for particular geographic areas. Right now, only Glean admins and team moderators can create new team pages, so contact them for information on how to get new teams set up.

This guide provides additional information on how to use team pages for teams you are a part of:

## Anatomy of a team page

Team profile pages contain detailed information about a team. Each page has a set of components, including:

* Team name
* What department the team is a part of
* Team membersWho is on the teamWho leads the team
* Team profile image
* Banner image
* "About" section for describing what the team does (this can include multiple paragraphs of rich text, with hyperlinks, images and more)
* Contact infoEmail addresses to contact the team (can be a team alias, or any other address)Team Slack channelsURLs (can link to any page, including intranet and external content)

Glean recommends ensuring that your team pages have informative and up-to-date descriptions, and links to relevant contact information. Some ideas for information to put in your team's description:

* A description of what your team is responsible for
* Information about who the correct contacts on your team are for cross-functional work
* Links to project plans and quarterly goals
* Information about upcoming events or key milestones

To edit these fields, click on the "edit" button in the upper-right-hand corner of the team page. Your organization may have particular style guides or best practices in place for teams pages â€” for information on that, contact your Glean admin.

## Team directory:

For easy discoverability, teams appear in the directory alongside people. Teams can be sorted by relevance, team size, and alphabetically by name. Teams can also be filtered by name. The screenshot below is what part of the teams directory looks like when sorted by relevance for an engineer on the Verticals team that works closely with Product. Clicking on a team links to the team profile page.

## Teams in search:

When your search indicates you are looking for a team, they will appear prominently in the results. These teams appear as expandable cards and can be expanded to show a subset of up to 6 members. Clicking on a card will take you to the team profile page.

Teams will also show up as autocomplete results as you are typing a query. If you click on the team name, you will be taken to the team's profile page.
