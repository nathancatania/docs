Glean app builder offers a variety of insights to help app creators and editors understand user behavior, app performance, and overall engagement. These insights are designed to provide actionable data that can help you improve your app and user experience.

## Overall

### Monthly Active App Users 

Monthly active app users measures the number of unique users who engage with your app in the last 28 days.

### Total Active App Users

Total active app users represents the cumulative number of unique users who have engaged with the app in the selected time period.

## Apps on Chat

### App Messages

App messages tracks the total number of messages sent by a user to the app in the selected time period. This count does not include the number of responses sent back from the app to a user.

### App Feedback Rate

App feedback rate measures the percentage of app messages sent on chat that have either been upvoted or downvoted in the selected time period.

<Info>
  App feedback rate = [Number of upvoted messages + Number of downvoted messages] / [Total messages]
</Info>

### App Upvote Rate

App upvote rate measures the percentage of app messages that have been upvoted out of all messages with upvotes or downvotes in the selected time period.

<Info>
  App upvote rate = [Number of upvoted messages] / [Number of upvoted messages + Number of downvoted messages]
</Info>

## Apps in Slack

### App Messages

App Messages measures the number of responses generated by Apps on Slack in the selected time period.

### App Messages Shared

App messages shared measures messages generated by apps in Slack that were upvoted and shared in the selected time period.

### App Downvotes

App downvotes measures the number of messages generated by apps in Slack that were downvoted ("Not helpful") in the selected time period.

## Known Limitations

<Warning>
  For apps deployed via APIs, the monthly active users (MAU) metric is reported as a single user, regardless of the actual number of unique users.
</Warning>

However, all other metrics, including total active app users, app messages, app feedback rate, app upvote rate, app messages shared, and app downvotes, remain unaffected.

## Conclusion

Understanding these insights and how they are calculated can help you make data-driven decisions to enhance your app's performance and user experience.
