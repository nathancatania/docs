Glean provides enterprise search capabilities that enable users to search across multiple applications through a unified interface. This guide outlines effective search practices and troubleshooting steps to help you maximize your search experience.

## Effective Search Techniques

### Global Search

The most comprehensive way to search across all accessible content is to use the asterisk (*) operator in the search bar. This approach retrieves results from all Glean instances you have permission to access, organized by connector type.

### Data Source-Specific Search

To narrow your search to a specific data source, use the syntax `app:datasource_name` in the search bar. For example, entering `app:jira` or `app:salesforce` will limit results to only that specific system.

Glean enhances this targeted search approach with data source-specific filters. For instance, when searching Jira content, you can filter by attributes such as Last Updated, From, and Type to refine your results further.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

When encountering search-related issues, consider the following factors and solutions:

### Access and Visibility Settings

Data source visibility settings play a crucial role in search results. If a data source is configured for a specific test group, only members of that group will be able to view and access documents from that source. To ensure proper access:

1. Verify that you are a member of the appropriate groups specified in the data source configuration page
2. Confirm that you have the necessary permissions in the original source system
3. Request your administrator to review your access permissions if needed

### Administrative Verification

Administrators can verify user access permissions through the following steps:

1. Navigate to the Workspace section
2. Select "Manage Search"
3. Use the "Verify Access" feature to check specific user permissions

### Permission Troubleshooting

If you're unable to find expected content, ensure that:

1. You belong to the user groups specified in the data source configuration
2. Your permissions are properly synchronized between the source system and Glean
3. The data source visibility settings align with your access requirements

<Note>
If you continue to experience issues after following these troubleshooting steps, contact your Glean administrator for additional assistance. They can help verify your permissions and resolve any access-related concerns.
