## Managing Data Source Visibility

To control whether a data source appears in search results:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Admin Console">
    Navigate to the [admin console](https://app.glean.com/admin/) > [Data sources](https://app.glean.com/admin/setup/apps)

    <Info>You must have Glean admin privileges to access these pages.</Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Data Source">
    Click on the specific data source you want to configure.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Search Results">
    In the Overview tab, locate the "Search results" section. Here you can:
    - Add the data source to search results
    - Remove the data source from search results
    - Limit search results to a select group of teammates (e.g., "test group")
  </Step>

## Test Groups

When setting up a new data source in Glean, you may want to test with a smaller group before enabling it for everyone. This ensures proper setup and expected search results.

### Setting Up a Test Group

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Test Group Settings">
    Go to [admin console](https://app.glean.com/admin/) > [Data sources](https://app.glean.com/admin/setup/apps)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Access Test Group Management">
    Click on the "Manage test group" button
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Team Members">
    Add teammates who already have access to Glean to the test group. Note that teammates will only see results from apps they have access to.
  </Step>
</Steps>
