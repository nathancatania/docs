### Permission Management

Answer Boards introduce board-level permission controls that streamline access management:

- Set specific departments as editors
- Define audience access at the board level
- Permissions automatically cascade to all Answers within the board

<Info>
  When you set permissions at the board level, all Answers contained within that board will inherit those same permissions. This makes it easier to manage access controls for entire collections of related content.
