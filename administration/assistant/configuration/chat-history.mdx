By default, all conversations between your users and Glean Assistant are saved so that they can be referred back to by the user later.

This includes interactions with both Company Knowledge and Public Knowledge modes. When enabled, Chat History is automatically maintained for 30 days by default. After this period, older chat data is purged by Glean automatically.
