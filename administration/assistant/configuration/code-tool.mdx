**About Machine Learning Workflows**

Glean runs several ML workflows monthly on your search index to:

- Understand organizational synonyms, acronyms, and semantics (including code comprehension)
- Enhance search result relevance and people suggestions
- Enable query suggestions and predictive text
- Train your organization's unique language model for Glean Chat and Assistant

Contact Glean support or your Glean engineer to request workflows outside the regular schedule.

<Warning>
If Glean Assistant isn't performing code searches or incorporating code in responses after linking GitHub/GitLab, the required machine learning workflows likely haven't run on your indexed code yet. Contact Glean support to request a manual workflow execution.
