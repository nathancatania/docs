## Overview

File Upload enables users to upload and analyze local files directly in Glean Assistant, Public Knowledge, and Apps. This feature allows users to query, summarize, and generate content from uploaded files. The upload limits vary based on the model used in your Glean instance.

<Info>
File content is stored in users' chat sessions for 24 hours, while file metadata is retained within the chat session for up to 30 days before deletion. Files are not added to your corpus and remain accessible only to the uploading user.
