6. Paste the URL you want to redirect to. The path and query parameters mentioned in the URL, along with their values mentioned in the URL, will be auto-filled below.

7. If you don’t want the value of any parameter to be constant, i.e. you want it to change based on the end user query - then please fill in all the allowed values in the “Allowed values” section.

* If only one value is present in Allowed values - that value will be constant
* If multiple values are present in Allowed values - one of those values will be selected by the LLM (Glean assistant) to fill in for this parameter depending on the “Description for LLM” and the end users query.
* If no values are present in Allowed values - any value can be filled for this parameter. If you don’t have a fixed set of values to choose from for a certain parameter, leave the Allowed Values field empty.

8. Please provide a detailed “Description for LLM” - the description/instructions here will help the LLM determine what value should be filled for this parameter. (This will be used for all the parameters that have none or more than 1 allowed values)

9. In order to see a preview/sample url, you can fill in a value in “Preview Data” field for each parameter that will be used to construct the Preview URL, which can be used for testing purposes.
