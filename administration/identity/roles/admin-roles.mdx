## Role Descriptions

### Setup Admin

<Card title="Setup Admin Role" icon="wrench">
The Setup Admin role is the most restrictive administrator role, focused specifically on application integration and setup. Their permissions include:

- Connecting and managing Single Sign-On settings
- Configuring and connecting datasource applications
- Initiating crawls for configured datasource apps
- Generating API tokens specifically for the Indexing API

This role is ideal for administrators of specific datasources that need integration with Glean. For example, assigning this role to your M365 administrator allows them to connect Glean to Entra ID SSO and configure crawling for SharePoint, Teams, and OneDrive.

### Admin

<Card title="Admin Role" icon="user-shield">
Admins possess broader capabilities compared to Setup Admins, including:

- Managing roles and permissions for all users (except Super Admin role)
- Configuring general Glean settings (company name, appearance, home page customizations)
- Managing Glean feature configurations (Org Chat, Glean Assistant)
- Generating API tokens for all Glean APIs (excluding global scope)
</Card>

### Super Admin

<Card title="Super Admin Role" icon="shield-check">
The Super Admin role encompasses all Admin permissions plus additional sensitive capabilities:

- Assigning Admin Search role and DLP moderator role
- Creating global scope API tokens
- Assigning the Super Admin role and all other permissions

<Info>
  The Super Admin role is disabled by default and requires written authorization from your company's CISO or Security Manager for initial assignment by Glean support. This role is typically reserved for senior security team members due to its access to sensitive content.
