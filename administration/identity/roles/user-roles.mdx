Glean implements a streamlined approach to user roles with a single primary role: **Member**. Members can receive additional **Moderator** permissions from Admins or Super Admins to manage content within specific platform features. Importantly, users with the Member role (including those with Moderator permissions) cannot access the Admin UI or Workspace Settings.

## Member Role

The Member role provides users with the following base permissions:
