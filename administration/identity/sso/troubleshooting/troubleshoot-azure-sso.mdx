When using Azure as your authentication method, users may encounter various login issues. This guide covers common authentication errors and their resolutions.

## User Redirected to Login Screen

### Error
User redirected to login screen

### Cause
This issue typically occurs when a user's email domain in Azure has not been added to Glean's allowed domains list.

### Resolution
Contact Glean Support to request the addition of the user's domain to your instance's allowed domains list.

## Error Code 13: SSO Code Exchange Failure

### Error
SSO code exchange failed [Error Code 13]

### Cause
This error appears when the client secret for your Azure App has expired.

### Resolution
1. Navigate to your Azure App configuration
2. Generate a new client secret
3. Access the Glean Admin Workspace Settings
4. Go to Setup > Authentication
5. Select your Azure App
6. Update the Client Secret field with the new value

## Error Code 14: User Authentication Failure

### Error
