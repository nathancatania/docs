## Overview

Team pages help organizations improve collaboration and visibility by providing centralized spaces for teams to share their mission, contact information, and membership. Each team page serves as a hub for others to better understand the team's work and how to engage with them.

## Team Creation Methods

<Card title="Automatic Generation" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
Teams can be automatically generated from your existing work systems:
- Google Groups
- Slack channels
- People attributes from Glean (e.g., department field)
  - Supports data from primary people sources like Okta, BambooHR, and Azure Active Directory

When setting up automated team creation, you can provide include/exclude lists to control which items become teams.
</Card>

<Card title="Manual Creation" icon="file-import">
Teams can also be created manually through:
- CSV upload to Google Cloud Storage
- JSON data submission via Glean Push API
</Card>

## Team Page Components

### Core Information
- Team name and department affiliation
- Team member roster and leadership
- Profile and banner images
- About section with rich text description

### Contact Details
- Team email addresses (including aliases)
- Slack channels
- Relevant URLs (internal and external resources)

## Discovery Features

### Team Directory

Teams appear alongside people in the directory for easy discovery. Users can:
- Sort teams by relevance, size, or alphabetically
- Filter teams by name
- Access team profiles directly from directory listings

### Search Integration

<Info>
Teams are surfaced prominently in search results when:
- A user explicitly searches for a team
- Team information is relevant to a search query
- Users begin typing a team-related search term (suggested results)
</Info>

## External Team Pages Integration

While Glean recommends using native team pages, organizations can integrate existing team pages:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configuration">
    Submit team data through:
    - Push API
    - Google Cloud Storage
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Link Override">
    Configure external page URLs to override default Glean team profiles
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
When external links are configured, users cannot access the native Glean team profile page.
</Warning>

## Implementation Recommendations

### Getting Started
1. Set up department-level teams as a foundation
2. Expand to functional teams (e.g., development pods, sales teams)
3. Include employee resource groups (ERGs)

### Content Management
Engage team leads to maintain their team pages:
- Update profile images and banners
- Write descriptive team information
- Configure preferred contact methods

## Technical Considerations

<Card title="Setup and Updates">
- Initial team creation takes approximately 30 minutes to propagate
- Changes may take up to an hour to fully sync
- Content updates from data sources follow similar timing
</Card>

### Content Governance
Currently, all team members can edit:
- Profile pictures
- Banner images
- Team descriptions
- Contact information

<Info>
Glean is developing enhanced governance models and welcomes customer feedback on desired controls.
