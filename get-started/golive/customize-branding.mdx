Administrators can control several aspects of Glean's look and feel to ensure that it fits with the rest of the tools that employees use at work.

The customization options include the following:

- **Company Branding:** These settings control the look of Glean everywhere, and include support for custom logos and colors.
- **Home page:** These settings control how the Glean home page appears to users across your company, and include settings for a default background image, quick actions, and available home page widgets.
- **Feature Enablement:** These settings control which features within the Glean app are enabled/disabled for your employees. E.g. You may wish to disable the org chart from being accessed by your users.

You must be assigned the **Admin** or **Super Admin** roles to be able to customize the workspace appearance.

Customize the look and feel of the Glean home page for your employees, including:

- **Cards:** Cards are the sections that are visible on the Glean home page for each of your users. These can include suggested documents, collections, and people celebrations.
- **Quick Actions:** Quick actions are the items that are displayed under the New button in the top-right corner of the Home and New Tab pages; providing shortcuts for your employees to create new content across all of your apps.
- **Default wallpapers:** You can set the default wallpaper that is used for both light and dark modes when users first open Glean.

## Feature Enablement

You can control which Glean features are enabled or disabled for your employees, e.g. Go Links, Org Chart, Assistant, etc.

Some features cannot be disabled or hidden from within the Admin UI and must be done so via Glean support.
