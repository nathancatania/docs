## Setting Up Glean Assistant

### Activate Glean Assistant

You can activate Glean Assistant by navigating to <SettingsAssistantSetup />, then selecting **Activate**.

Once you have completed these steps, the Assistant menu option will become visible and you can activate Glean Assistant.

To set explicit exclusion (or inclusion) rules, navigate to <SettingsAssistantAdvanced />, then expand the **Exclusion rules** and **Inclusion rules** sections.
