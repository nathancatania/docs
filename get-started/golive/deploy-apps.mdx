Glean's apps are designed to make it easy for your users to access Glean Assistant and Glean Search.

By default, a user must access Glean by explicitly typing `https://app.glean.com` into their browser, or by clicking the Glean tile in your company's SSO App Library. Both of these options have significant friction to them, and on their own, lead to poor adoption of Glean.

The best way to drive Glean adoption at your company is by deploying the Glean browser extension and Glean apps to their corporate devices.


## Browser Extension

The Glean Browser Extension provides a better user experience and creates habits for higher adoption and usage, allowing everyone to get the most out of Glean.
