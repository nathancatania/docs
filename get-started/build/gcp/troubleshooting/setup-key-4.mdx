## Issue

- The org constraint doesn't match the policy specification required by Glean

## Resolution

- From the error message on the validation page, note the constraint name and the required spec. From the example error message below, we can infer the constraint name to be constraints/iam.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation and the required policy spec to be `{"rules":[{"enforce": false}]}`

- Create a yaml (say its located at /tmp/policy.yaml) file with the below configuration:
    ```yaml
    name: projects/PROJECT_ID/policies/iam.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation
    spec:
    rules:
        - enforce: false
    ```

- Execute the below command with credentials sufficient to modify org constraints in your organizations:
```bash
gcloud org-policies set-policy /tmp/policy.yaml
```

- Reupload the owner key
