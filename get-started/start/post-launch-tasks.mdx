## 1. Conduct a Follow-Up Survey

~4 weeks after the kickoff to the initial wave of users, you should send out a survey to collect their thoughts and experiences, and examine how the results from the initial survey have changed.

This feedback is crucial for understanding what's working and what might need tweaking before the next wave of users is brought on-board.


### Survey Template

Glean offers a template for the follow-up survey designed to gather all necessary user insights effectively. This template can be used as-is or can be customized to better fit the specific needs of your organization.

- [Glean Follow-Up User Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1LgXBqKJqlP8q_xpR2p0J9h7_QI8wCUcE6XGZn5VFeUI) (Google Forms)

You should ensure that all of your initial users have completed the survey before on-boarding the next group.

<Check>
Consider posting an **Announcement** in Glean that mandates the completion of this survey for all users.
</Check>


## 2. Deploy Additional Users

If user feedback is positive, start to expand the Glean rollout to additional waves of users.

If your initial rollout was only within a single department or team, you should now expand to additional business units.


## 3. Meet with Glean

If not in place already, ensure that regular meetings with your Glean Customer Success Manager (CSM) have been scheduled.

These are invaluable for troubleshooting, exploring new features, and ensuring that your Glean deployment continues to go smoothly.
