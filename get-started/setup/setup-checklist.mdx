<Steps titleSize="h3">  
    <Step title="SSO Administrator & Information">
    You will need an administrator of your Single Sign-On (SSO) provider (e.g. Entra ID, Okta, Jumpcloud, Google Workspace, etc) on-hand to configure SSO for Glean.
    </Step>
    <Step title="People Data Source">
    If you are using SAML for SSO instead of OIDC, you will need to identify a datasource that your corporate directory can be synchronized from. Glean has separate connectors for Entra ID/Azure and Okta available, as well as connectors for common HR apps like Workday BambooHR.
    
    If you are uncertain about this requirement, please contact your Glean account team.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Data source Administrators">       
    You will need an administrator for each data source or cloud-app you wish to connect to Glean (e.g., M365, Atlassian, Slack, GitHub).
    
    These administrators will either authorize the installation of the Glean app within their respective data source or create a scoped API token for Glean's use.
    </Step>
