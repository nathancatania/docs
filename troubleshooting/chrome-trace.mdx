When you experience performance issues, our engineering team may request a Chrome trace to diagnose and resolve the problem.

<Info>
  Chrome traces help our engineers understand exactly what's causing performance bottlenecks, allowing us to optimize the experience for you.
</Info>

<Warning>
  **Privacy Considerations**

  Chrome traces may contain sensitive information including:
  - URLs and titles of open tabs
  - Running browser extensions

  To protect your privacy, consider closing unnecessary tabs before recording. Note that traces do **not** include your browser history.

  We recommend using the [CloudFlare HAR File Sanitizer](https://har-sanitizer.pages.dev/) to remove any sensitive information from the trace file before sharing it with Glean.
