## Issue

The VM that processes git repository content (files, directories, commits) cannot process crawler requests.

## Resolution

Please ensure the VM is set to accept requests from the Glean Proxy IP fromt the Transit VPC, and that appropriate permissions are in place to allow the fetching of repository content.

For additional assistance, please contact Glean Support at [https://support.glean.com](https://support.glean.com)
