## Issue:

There was an unexpected issue during setup.

## Resolution:

If you were configuring a data source:
- Please ensure that the email used to sign into Glean matches the email used to sign into the data source.
- Ensure that there are no IP allowlists in place that would prevent Glean from accessing the data source.
- Ensure that the admin authorizing the Glean integration has full priviledges to do so across the entire data source.
