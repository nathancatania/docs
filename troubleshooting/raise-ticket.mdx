When you need assistance from our support team, following these best practices will help us resolve your issues more efficiently. Whether you're experiencing technical difficulties, have questions about our products, or need account assistance, providing comprehensive information in your support ticket will streamline the resolution process.

## Ticket Content Guidelines

The information you include in your support ticket plays a crucial role in how quickly and effectively we can address your needs. Below are the essential details to include in your ticket:

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Issue Description" icon="message-dots">
    Provide a clear, detailed explanation of the problem you're experiencing. Include information about what you were attempting to do when the issue occurred and any steps that can be taken to reproduce the problem. This context helps our support team understand the full scope of the situation.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Error Messages" icon="circle-exclamation">
    If you encountered an error message, include the exact text or error code that was displayed. These specific details often provide our support team with valuable clues about the root cause of the issue.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Timing Information" icon="clock">
    Note the date and time when the issue occurred, along with your timezone. This temporal context helps our support team correlate your experience with system logs and event histories, enabling more precise investigation.
  </Card>

  <Card title="User Impact" icon="users">
    Specify whether the issue affects just your account or multiple users. This information helps us determine if the problem is isolated to a specific account or indicates a broader system issue.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Document Reference" icon="link">
    For issues related to specific content, such as missing search results or permission problems, include the relevant URL. Direct links help us quickly locate and examine the content in question.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Visual Evidence" icon="image">
    When possible, attach screenshots or recordings that demonstrate the issue. Visual documentation can often communicate complex problems more effectively than written descriptions alone.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Understanding Priority Levels

Selecting the appropriate priority level for your ticket helps our support team properly allocate resources and manage response times. Here's how to determine the right priority level for your issue:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Low Priority" icon="arrow-down">
    Choose this level for non-critical issues that don't impact your daily operations. Examples include:
    - General product inquiries
    - Feature requests
    - Questions about future functionality
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Normal Priority" icon="arrow-right">
    Select this level for issues that affect some aspects of your operations but don't significantly hinder your workflow. These issues require attention but aren't time-critical.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="High Priority" icon="arrow-up">
    Use this level when facing issues that seriously impact your ability to use the product or service effectively. These problems need prompt attention to restore normal operations.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Urgent Priority" icon="alarm-exclamation">
    Reserve this level for critical issues that:
    - Cause a complete halt to your operations
    - Severely impact your business functionality
    - Require immediate resolution, such as system outages
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
Remember that accurate priority classification helps ensure our support team can effectively triage and address all customer needs. Over-escalating priority levels may actually slow down resolution times for genuinely critical issues.
