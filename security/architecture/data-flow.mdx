The Glean platform architecture consists of three primary components that work together to provide secure and effective enterprise data access:

## Query Path

### Web Application Overview

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initial Access">
    Users access Glean through the web application at [https://app.glean.com](https://app.glean.com), hosted within Glean's central cloud infrastructure. The application serves static assets including images, CSS, and JavaScript.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Session Check">
    The web client checks for an existing session state in the user's local storage. If none exists, authentication is required as anonymous searching is not supported.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authentication Process">
    Users begin by entering their email address (e.g., `user@company.com`).

    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Tenant Resolution

<Info>
Each customer tenant requires a list of company domain names for authentication. These domains are mapped to a tenant-specific Query Endpoint (QE) of the form `<tenant_id>-be.glean.com`.
</Info>

The authentication process follows these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Domain Lookup">
    When a user submits their email, the web app performs a domain lookup to determine the appropriate QE domain.
    
    <Frame>
      ![Domain Resolution](assets/data-flow.20240208181615936.webp)
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="QE Assignment">
    The QE domain resolves to a static IP uniquely assigned to your company's Glean tenant, whether deployed in Glean SaaS or your own cloud environment.

    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="SSO Integration">
    Unauthenticated users are redirected to your configured SSO provider for authentication.

```

### Query Endpoint Communication

When users perform searches, requests are sent to:
```
https://<tenant_id>-be.glean.com/api/v1/search
```

## Data Ingestion Flow

Glean's data ingestion process is built around specialized connectors deployed within your tenant's dedicated cloud project. These connectors serve multiple purposes:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Content Retrieval" icon="file-arrow-down">
    Fetches content from connected enterprise sources
  </Card>
  <Card title="Activity Tracking" icon="chart-line">
    Monitors user interaction data
  </Card>
  <Card title="Permission Mapping" icon="lock">
    Maps and maintains access controls
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Connection Methods

<Info>
Data retrieval occurs via HTTPS, with two primary connection patterns depending on the data source location.
</Info>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="SaaS Applications" icon="cloud">
    For services like Google Drive, connections occur over the public internet using HTTPS
  </Card>
  <Card title="On-Premises Systems" icon="server">
    For internal systems like on-prem Jira, secure private connections are established via VPN or Shared VPC
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Data Processing Pipelines

<Warning>
All data processing occurs within your tenant's project using Google Dataflow pipelines. Your data never leaves your tenant's environment.
</Warning>

The processing pipeline combines:
- Content from connected sources
- Permission mappings
- User data
- Activity metrics (creation, edits, views)

This combined data is then indexed to create a secure, searchable knowledge base within your tenant.
