For successful connectivity with Glean services, you need to allowlist specific IP ranges through your firewalls and security controls. This configuration is essential for two purposes:
- Enabling Glean to receive data from connected data sources
- Allowing users to connect to Glean services

There are two distinct categories of IP addresses that require allowlisting: Glean Central addresses and your specific Glean tenant addresses.

## Glean Central

Glean Central serves as the centralized control plane tenant for the service. This critical infrastructure component is responsible for:

- Orchestrating all underlying customer environments
- Pushing service updates to all tenancies
- Handling tenancy lookup and redirection during user login
- Aggregating health data and anonymized analytics for each tenancy
- Managing front-end and routing of OAuth flows from certain apps (like Box, Jira, etc.) to the corresponding customer tenancy

### Glean Central IP Addresses

The following static IP addresses are used by Glean Central and should be allowlisted:

```text
104.154.230.46/32
35.239.35.180/32
34.120.39.18/32
35.238.31.70/32
34.120.90.191/32
34.120.148.20/32
34.111.103.238/32
34.160.40.155/32
```

## Customer Tenant Configuration

Each Glean customer deployment operates in isolation with its own dedicated backend domain (e.g., `companyname-be.glean.com`). Your tenancy is assigned three (3) public IP addresses that serve the following purposes:

<Card title="Inbound Webhooks" icon="bell">
Handles notifications and webhooks from connected applications
</Card>

<Card title="Crawler Egress" icon="spider">
Manages outbound connections for data crawling operations
</Card>

<Card title="Load Balancing" icon="server">
Handles inbound user queries from the Glean application interface and API requests
</Card>
